### Description

This is simple database program to demonstrate the use of ADO and OOP. The program includes functionality to navigate through the records, add, save, delete and find. All functionality are encapsulated in a class. The program contains very minimal error trapping, error handling and input validation. No data bound controls are used in this program. The program shows how to use ADO, Classes, Basic Module, Simulated inheritance and more. I intend to expand this further to include an error trapping and validation class. Other functionality will be included soon. In fact, this is a subset of a larger database program for a retail store.
